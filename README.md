# Spotify Billboard Hot 100 Analysis

A program that will analyze a dataset from Spotifyâ€™s Billboard Hot 100.

Our project will be able to identify popular genres, artists, and audio metrics that makes a song reach The Hot 100. The project will be able to extract from the selected dataset and visualize it with graphs such as pie charts and bar graphs using spotipy and matplotlib modules in Python. Our project will not be creating our own plotting modules or analyzing songs outside The Hot 100.

## Scope

Our project will be able to identify popular genres, artists, and audio metrics that makes a song reach The Hot 100. The project will be able to extract from the selected dataset and visualize it with graphs such as pie charts and bar graphs using spotipy and matplotlib modules in Python. Our project will not be creating our own plotting modules or analyzing songs outside The Hot 100.

### Project Breakdown and Division of Labor

The main software components will be scripts that will retrieve the data with spotipy and read data from the .csv file which will plot a graph based on a specific metric (ex. frequency of genre, frequency of artist, frequency of album).

The non-programming task is learning spotipy API and matplotlib modules which will be handled by the researcher.
